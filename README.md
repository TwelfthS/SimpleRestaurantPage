# SimpleRestaurantPage
A pseudo-restaurant page where you can create "orders" from menu

Start the mysql service (net start mysql80 on Windows), open src/chapter_1 or src/chapter_2, run "npm -i", "npm run dbr", and "node app.js"

In chapter 2 aside from creating orders you can log in as waiter of admin. Waiter can create orders, admin can view all active orders (but can't create them or close them)
